# For Goodness Cakes

This website application was designed with the idea of taking a bakery, For Goodness Cakes's, Instagram and turning it into a working website. Site allows baker to showcase goods, update an announcement bulletin, receive Calendly consultation appointments, and receive emails of all orders and 'contact me' submissions. Site allows users to browse goods, schedule a consultation, submit an order and email the baker directly from the site.
